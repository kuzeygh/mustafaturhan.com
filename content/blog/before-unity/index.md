there is a thing that people must not forget: "first thing first." for example, if you want to learn unity(as game engine) but don't know anything about c#; don't start to learning with unity. start with c#. and no, javascript isn't equal with c#. and no, making games with html's canvas isn't same thing with making actual games. and yes, you can use visual studio code with c#, thanks to extensions.
