well, i'm trying to learn c# and unity together. actually, unity has a "[unity learn](https://learn.unity.com)" web page for beginners which is awesome because you don't need anything else but there is a little problem about... i don't know, i guess about me. i feel like i can't learn to code in unity unless there is a real project. maybe i will make **monthly game** challenges that i create small games in the coming days. i don't know.
