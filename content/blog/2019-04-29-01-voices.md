there is too much voice in my head. i should do/learn everything, according to that voices but i can't. i am trying to learn game development one day, trying to learn blender/3d design another day. i shouldn't do this.

nevermind. i have just a one thing in my hands: front-end development. i will try to improve my front-end skills.
