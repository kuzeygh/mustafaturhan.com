i'm becoming hopeless about game development because i didn't look anything like 4 days. learning new things can be hard but i'm trying you know. i didn't give up yet and i won't. so, here is an idea: i don't know will you remember this but there was a game that played with a circle ball. no, not bounce. i made a little search on internet and found it: ["ballance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballance). i will make something like that. yes, i will. or, i don't know; lets say maybe.
