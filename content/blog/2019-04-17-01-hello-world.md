yes, i get it. web 3.0 is good thing am i right? anybody can create content about everything. look at wikipedia, twitter, youtube, facebook... i mean, there is a lot of social media platforms that you can create content in it which is ok because "free speech ;)" but i am tired. people are so mean and i don't want to read them like used to be. i am scared now you know? i am afraid to write a tweet about my thoughts on global warming or learning new programming languages or something. communication should have been a good thing but it isn't.

oh, nevermind. like i said, "hello world. i should write a microblog because there is nobody to write a bad comment in here."
