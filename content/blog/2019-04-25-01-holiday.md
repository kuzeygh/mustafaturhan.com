i went to holiday last week. you know what, working is sucks. there is too much place that you have to explore. "look, there was a living people in here 2400 years ago but nothing now. so, you will die one day. why you spend a lot of time to working?"

pff, never mind. holiday is over, so... "hello darkness, my old friend."
