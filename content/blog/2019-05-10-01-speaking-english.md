learning a new language seems easy. not a computer language by the way, i am talking about languages like english, german, chinese or something. the real problem isn't learning, it is thinking. if you can't think in english, you can't speak it right like me. i am following this pattern when i speak english:

- think in turkish,
- speak but not loudly, in your brain.
- when you catch "oh, it's a good sentence." thought, translate it to english, in your brain again.
- say it.

but it is wrong and unnatural. and i don't know what to do. everybody says "you need some practice" but what if i don't have a chance to speak with somebody? actually, i think this is my biggest problem to find a job in countries except turkey.
