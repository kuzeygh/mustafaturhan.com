my game development adventure is over, i can't do it. game development isn't for me and i learned it from hard way but it's ok. at least i learned some c# and unity, i can answer some questions if someone ask.

and it isn't only thing that over. my hopes about this country -which is turkey- is over too. i will go with front-end development.
